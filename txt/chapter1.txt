Your foot slips in the dirt as you make a sharp turn to the left, your hand firmly gripping the canvas bag of meat that the shopkeeper so graciously bagged for you. After hitting a solid stride, you glance backwards to see your friend… ${Friend}. You've been friends for years. Growing up poor in the bustling streets of the capital city of ${Nation}, ${Capitol}, can be a dangerous existence, and you've watched each other's backs.

"[i]…${Name}! Keep going![/i]" shouts ${Friend}, as you note the growing distance between you both and the shopkeeper.

You begin to turn at the end of the street, cutting around the corner of another building… when you run face first into someone!
*page_break Ouch!

You feel as if you've smashed your face against a brick wall. Stumbling backwards, you gather your senses and look up to see a strong man in his late forties, wearing a simple tan robe. He strokes his long grey beard and examines you quizzically. 

"[i]Give back what you stole![/i]" cries the shop owner as he begins to close in.

"[i]Now what is going on here?[/i]" says the man.

You shoot from off the ground and try to brush past the man. 

He steps in front of you and smiles.

"[i]Now where did you find that?[/i]" gesturing towards the bag in your hand.

You angle your shoulder to collide with the man and shove by him, but again you are shocked by how rooted he feels. 

*if Nation = "Fikon"
 You stumble back from the impact once again, only this time - he closes the distance between you in the blink of an eye. Before you can even register his movement, his palm gently presses against your shoulder as you feel your right leg fly out in front of you. You trip, falling flat on your back.

Turning away from the mysterious man, you lock eyes with ${Friend}. He nearly crashes into you too in the midst of his mad sprint as the sweaty, red-faced shopkeeper approaches behind him.

"[i]Thank you Master ${Master}! Please take these two to the jail! They stole from my shop![/i]" says the shopkeeper, furious and exasperated.

Luckily… "Master ${Master}" advocates for both you and ${Friend}, claiming that he sent his two students (you) to get some meat for dinner tonight, only to have forgotten to give you the money to do so. Being the two "dedicated and loyal students" you are, you accepted the assignment with no questions. 

"[i]My most sincere apologies for what my forgetfulness has caused. Please forgive this shame upon my gym.[/i]" says Master ${Master} as he returns the bag to the shopkeeper with a deep bow.

"[i]Oh, Master ${Master}, it was no problem at all! We all make mistakes! Please feel free to drop back by my shop any time![/i]" says the shopkeeper as he cautiously takes the bag and returns to his shop.

Once the shopkeeper is out of earshot, Master ${Master} grabs you and ${Friend} by your shirts and looks at you both.

"[i]You two will be following me back to my gym.[/i]" he says, starting directly into your eyes.
*page_break

You and ${Friend} cautiously follow ${Master} back to his gym. You walk into the wide, wooden, one-level building; immediately noting the ${TrainingEquipment}… the gym must be quite successful.

Once inside, he turns to face you.

"[i]Have you two little miscreants ever had to defend yourselves?[/i]"

You look at ${Friend}…
*page_break "[i]Why are we here?[/i]"

"[i]Well, foremost, I should take you to the jail for your crimes."

…

"[i]However! I see much of my younger self when I see you two. I will be taking you both on as my pupils.[/i]"
*page_break "[i]What?[/i]"

"[i]I can clearly see you have no better use for your time… so I expect to see you both back here tomorrow at 6am.[/i]" he concludes sternly.

You and ${Friend} make your way back to your neighborhood,  parting ways as you walk into your home…

"[i] [/i]"
